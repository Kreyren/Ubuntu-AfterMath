# Note
This Installer installs most things for your newly Installed Ubuntu OS! If you want to use custom modify, You need to edit it yourself. and please do fork this project if you use it! (THIS IS NOT DESIGNED FOR WINDOWS!). I've tried to add as many as softwares and dependencies I can.

# What is it?
It's my ubuntu softwares auto installer because I'm lazy to download and install softwares to setup it everytime I install Ubuntu. So I decided to make my own installer!

# How to use it?
It's simple. First of all, you need to download it by either downloading it from GitHub, or running this command to download:
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uniminin/Ubuntu-AfterMath/master/installer.sh`.

After you do this, copy, paste and run the command: `chmod +x installer.sh && ./installer.sh`, and it will take you into the install process! Remember to be in root directory first. Before copything and pasting these commands please be in root dir by `sudo -i`.

python3 script process: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uniminin/Ubuntu-AfterMath/master/installer.py` and then `python3 installer.py`
